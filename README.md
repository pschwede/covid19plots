## German registry for intensive care (DIVI)

Did German hospitals exceed their capacity recently? I scraped alert data from [German registry for intensive care (DIVI)](https://divi.de/register/intensivregister). To scrape it yourself, simply run `scrape/divi.py <outfile>`. However, feel free to use [the already scraped and continuously updated data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pschwede/covid19plots/master/data/divi.tsv). Also see [scrape_divi.ipynb](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/scrape_divi.ipynb) for plots.
