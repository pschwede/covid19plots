#### Correlations

[**Scatter-Matrix:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/scatter_matrix.ipynb) Does the number of cases in intensive care correlate well with the number positive diagnoses? Also, how many days remain until death?

[**Correlate World Data:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/correlate.ipynb) Where in the world hits COVID-19 the hardest and why?

#### Trends

[**Reproduction:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/doc/repro.md) How fast is the virus spreading?

[**Lethality:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/doc/lethality.md) How likely does one die after a positive COVID-19 diagnosis?

[**Countries in Comparison:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/countries_in_comparison.ipynb) Did you know that apparently ~3x~ 5x more people per million died due to COVID-19 in Sweden than in Germany?

[**German Headlines**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/topst_headlines.ipynb) How did media react to COVID-19?

[**Total VS Week:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/sum_vs_window.ipynb) It's a simple thought: The more people have been infected, the more people should get infected the next week. However, as soon the relation ceases to hold, the vicious circle stops. I plot [those graphs](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/) for German federal states.

[**German Registry for Intensive Care (DIVI):**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/scrape_divi.ipynb) Did German hospitals exceed their [capacity](https://www.intensivregister.de/#/intensivregister) recently? I scraped their [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pschwede/covid19plots/master/data/divi.tsv) for plots. (I dont't do scraping anymore, though!)

#### Speculation

[**Future Projection:**](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/doc/projection.md) What will the COVID-19 future look like? The same *non-exponential* model is used in [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303039) and [[2]](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/predicting-the-spread-of-covid-19-coronavirus-in-us-daily-updates-4de238ad8c26)
