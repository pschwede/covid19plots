### Projection attempts

#### Naiive Logistic continuation

Assume that the whole population is available for infection. Use the most recent [logistic r-values](https://github.com/pschwede/covid19plots/blob/master/doc/repro.md) to project into the future.
Some assume that actually four times more people have been infected than is measured through tests (see the curve of "Cases x4".)
